# GEOMETOR

An open-source project for exploring geometry, nature, and logic.

## Overview

A Python library for creating symbolic models of geometric constructions, investigating patterns in nature, and exploring abstraction and reasoning. A key motivation is the exploration of the golden ratio.

## Key Repos

-   **model**: The core library for geometric constructions.
-   **explorer**: A web-based UI for the model, using Flask and SVG.
-   **divine**: Analysis of golden sections in a model.
-   **elements**: Explorations of Euclid's Elements.
-   **seer**: An AI-driven framework for solving abstract reasoning challenges.
